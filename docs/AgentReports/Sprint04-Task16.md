# Sprint04-Task16 - controls audit

## Scope & Files
- Tightened process gates in `docs/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md`, `docs/TaskPipeline.md`, and `docs/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` (clean-tree stop + playbook, Snapcase-Flow-Mockups read-only, C:\Repos\SnapCase_App only, diagnostics hygiene, simplified UX references, preflight snippet for reuse). Added explicit agent role line to the prompt template (e.g., Senior UX Engineer).
- Made `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` more concise and added the Windows remote-builder reminder to the alias workflow.
- Logged outcomes in `PROGRESS.md` (branch `task/Sprint04-Task16-controls-audit` in `C:\Repos\SnapCase_App`).
